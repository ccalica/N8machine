N8 Font Generator - Complete 256-character hybrid aesthetic font

Generates:
- C header file (n8_font.h) with uint8_t n8_font[256][16]
- SVG preview of all 256 characters in a 16x16 grid
- Python dict for programmatic use

Hybrid approach:
- ASCII letters/numbers: Based on PCFace Modern DOS 8x16 (CC0)
- Box drawing: Sharp + Rounded + Heavy (custom hybrid)
- Card suits: Organic curves (Direction A)
- Geometric: Sharp angular (Direction B)
- Overall: Utility (C) with personality (A)
